# Habit Tracker with Analytics

A lightweight Python-based **Habit Tracking Application** that makes it easier to keep track of your habits with streak analytics
to see how much progress you have made with each habit.

The Habit Tracker is a command-line application designed to help users build, track, and analyze their habits. Whether you want to establish a daily workout routine, read weekly, or break bad habits, this app provides a structured way to monitor progress and stay accountable.

Users can create, edit, and delete habits, and track progress through daily, weekly, and monthly streak calculations that will keep you
more informed about the habits you are forming.  

This project was built as part of a IU International University of Applied AScience learning project in applying fundamental principles
when building a Python project using object orientated principles.
